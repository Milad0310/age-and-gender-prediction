# Age & Gender_Classification with pytorch
## classify images containing  male &amp; female

# model

This is the implementation of Age and Gender Classification using PyTorch as the deep 
learning framework and Google Colab as the training ground.

. we use kaggle api dataset in google colab

. Face detection using Haar Cascades (frontal face and profile face) and Neural Network (VGG19)
# Datasets :

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.

# Haar Cascade Classifiers
Haar Cascade files can be downloaded from the OpenCV repository.



# known issues
training this model taking a lot of time so we will use transfer learning soon...
